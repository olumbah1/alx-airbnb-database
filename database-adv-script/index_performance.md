# Identify high-usage columns in your User, Booking, and Property tables (e.g., columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY clauses).

Table: user
Column 	         Usage Potential	              Index Recommendation
user_id	     Primary key, used in JOINs	       ‚úÖ Already indexed (PK)
email	     Likely filtered (WHERE email =)   ‚úÖ Needs index
created_at	  Possibly sorted or filtered	   ‚úÖ Optional index if used


Table: property
Column	         Usage Potential	             Index Recommendation
property_id	Primary key, used in JOIN with booking/review ‚úÖ Already indexed (PK)
host_id	        Used in JOIN with user	               ‚úÖ Needs index
location	Possibly filtered (e.g., WHERE location =) ‚úÖ Optional index
pricepernight	Could be used in filtering or sorting  ‚úÖ Optional index
created_at	       Sorted or filtered by date	       ‚úÖ Optional index


Table: booking
Column	              Usage Potential	            Index Recommendation
booking_id          	Primary key	             ‚úÖ Already indexed (PK)
property_id	       Used in JOIN with property 	 ‚úÖ Needs index
user_id	             Used in JOIN with user	     ‚úÖ Needs index
start_date, end_date Filter/sort range-based queries	‚úÖ Index useful
status	    Frequently filtered (WHERE status =)	    ‚úÖ Index useful
created_at	    Ordered or filtered by date         ‚úÖ Optional index


Table: payment
Column	            Usage Potential	           Recommendation
booking_id	        JOIN with booking	   ‚úÖ Index recommended
payment_date	    Filtering/sorting	   ‚úÖ Optional index


# Measure the query performance before and after adding indexes using EXPLAIN or ANALYZE.

Let's Use This Query for EXPLAIN

We'll analyze this real-world query:

SELECT *
FROM booking
WHERE user_id = 'abc-123'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

‚ùå BEFORE Index (No helpful index exists)

If you run:

EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM booking
WHERE user_id = 'abc-123'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

You might get something like this (PostgreSQL or MySQL output):

Seq Scan on booking  (cost=0.00..4200.00 rows=500 width=...)
  Filter: (user_id = 'abc-123')


Explanation:

üü• Seq Scan = Sequential scan of the whole table.

The database checks every row in booking to find matching user_id

Very slow for large datasets

‚úÖ Create Index to Optimize

Now add a composite index that matches both WHERE and ORDER BY:


CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_created_at
ON booking(user_id, created_at DESC);

This index helps because it matches both:
WHERE user_id = ...
ORDER BY created_at DESC

‚úÖ AFTER Index

Now run the same EXPLAIN again:

EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM booking
WHERE user_id = 'abc-123'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

You'll likely get:

Index Scan using idx_booking_user_created_at on booking
  Index Cond: (user_id = 'abc-123')


Explanation:

üü© Index Scan means it‚Äôs using the new index ‚úÖ

It's only scanning matching rows
It can also return them already sorted by created_at DESC
Much faster performance
